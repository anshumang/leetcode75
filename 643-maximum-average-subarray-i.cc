This problem asks for the maximum average of a contiguous subarray of a fixed length k, which is a perfect candidate for the Sliding Window technique.

A brute-force approach would be to calculate the sum of every possible subarray of length k, but that would be too slow (O(n*k)), given the constraints.
  The sliding window approach allows us to do this in a single pass.

Sliding Window Algorithm
The core idea is to maintain a "window" of k elements and its sum. As we iterate through the array, we "slide" this window one element at a time to the right.
  Instead of recalculating the sum of the new window from scratch, we can update the sum efficiently in constant time.

Initialize the Window:

First, calculate the sum of the initial window, which consists of the first k elements of the array (nums[0] to nums[k-1]).
Store this sum as our initial max_sum.
Slide the Window:

Iterate through the rest of the array, starting from the k-th element.
In each step, we update the window's sum by:
Adding the new element that is just entering the window from the right.
Subtracting the old element that is falling off the window from the left.
After each slide, compare the current window's sum with max_sum and update max_sum if the current sum is greater.
Calculate the Final Average:

After iterating through the entire array, max_sum will hold the maximum sum found among all subarrays of length k.
The maximum average is simply max_sum / k.
C++ Solution
Here is a C++ implementation of the sliding window algorithm.
  We use double for the sum to maintain precision and avoid integer overflow, though a long long would also work for the sum before the final division.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>   // For std::accumulate
#include <algorithm> // For std::max

class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Step 1: Initialize the first window's sum.
        // Using a double for the sum to maintain precision throughout.
        double window_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            window_sum += nums[i];
        }
        
        double max_sum = window_sum;

        // Step 2: Slide the window through the rest of the array.
        // The loop starts from the element that will be the first new element in the window.
        for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // Update the sum: add the new element and subtract the old one.
            window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            
            // Update the maximum sum found so far.
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, window_sum);
        }
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the final average from the maximum sum.
        return max_sum / k;
    }
};

// Helper function to test the solution
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    
    // Example 1
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3};
    int k1 = 4;
    std::cout << "Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4" << std::endl;
    std::cout.precision(5);
    std::cout << "Output: " << std::fixed << sol.findMaxAverage(nums1, k1) << std::endl; // Expected: 12.75000

    // Example 2
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {5};
    int k2 = 1;
    std::cout << "\nInput: nums = [5], k = 1" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Output: " << std::fixed << sol.findMaxAverage(nums2, k2) << std::endl; // Expected: 5.00000

    return 0;
}
