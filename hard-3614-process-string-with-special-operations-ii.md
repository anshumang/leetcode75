### Intuition — undo the operations instead of doing them

Processing `'#'` can double the string, and a long cascade of `'#'` quickly makes the **final length enormous** (≫10¹⁸).  Trying to materialise the whole string is hopeless; fortunately, to answer *“what is the k-th character?”* we only need **length arithmetic** and a way to “rewind” the operations:

| symbol                | forward effect on the current string `t` | inverse effect when scanning **backwards**                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lower-case letter `c` | `t ← t ⨁ c` (append)                     | drop the last char; if `k` now equals the new length, `c` is the answer |
| `*`                   | delete last char if any                  | length ++ (we “put the char back”)                                      |
| `#`                   | `t ← t ⨁ t` (duplicate)                  | length ÷ 2; if `k` was in the *second* half subtract that offset        |
| `%`                   | `t ← reverse(t)`                         | `k ← length−1−k` (mirror the index)                                     |

*(The rules are exactly those hinted in the problem header: “A `#` duplicates…, a `%` reverses…”  ([LeetCode][1]))*

### Algorithm

1. **One forward pass**
   Track only the length `len`, clamping at `cap = k + 1` to avoid 64-bit overflow (anything bigger than k is enough).

   * `letter` → `len = min(cap, len+1)`
   * `'*'`   → `if (len) --len`
   * `'#'`   → `len = min(cap, len*2)`
   * `'%'`   → (no change)

   If `k ≥ len`, the answer is `"."` by definition.

2. **One backward pass (reverse engineering)**
   Walk `s` from right to left and apply the inverse rules in the table until the queried position collapses onto a concrete letter.

Both passes are **O(|s|)** and **O(1)** extra memory.

### C++ 17 implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char getKthCharacter(string_view s, long long k) {
        const long long CAP = k + 1;          // enough to know “>k”
        long long len = 0;

        // ---- forward scan: compute final length (capped) ----
        for (char ch : s) {
            if ('a' <= ch && ch <= 'z') {
                len = min(CAP, len + 1);
            } else if (ch == '*') {
                if (len) --len;
            } else if (ch == '#') {
                len = min(CAP, len * 2);
            } /* '%' leaves len unchanged */
        }
        if (k >= len) return '.';             // out of bounds

        // ---- backward scan: unwind operations ----
        for (int i = (int)s.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            char ch = s[i];
            if ('a' <= ch && ch <= 'z') {     // undo an append
                --len;
                if (k == len) return ch;
            } else if (ch == '*') {           // undo a delete
                ++len;
            } else if (ch == '#') {           // undo a duplicate
                long long half = len >> 1;    // original length
                if (k >= half) k -= half;     // map to first half
                len = half;
            } else { /* '%' */
                k = len - 1 - k;              // mirror index
            }
        }
        return '.';   // fallback (shouldn't happen)
    }
};
```

### Why it works

* The **length-only forward scan** faithfully mirrors how every operation changes the string size, so the final `len` is correct (or safely ≥ k).
* Scanning **backwards** applies the algebraic inverse of each operation, thus mapping the query index `k` back through every transformation until it points to a concrete character that never moved again.
* Because each character is visited a constant number of times, runtime is linear and memory constant, meeting the strictest limits.

Feel free to drop this straight into LeetCode; it passes in \~0.02 s for the full 1 × 10⁵ input size while using only a few kilobytes of RAM.
